Here are each of the multiplier and their respective multiplication value:

Mutations: Crops and Pets can gain these.

Golden: 25x
Rainbow: 50x
Weather Conditions: Only crops can gain these.

Wet: 2x
Chilled: 2x
Frozen: 10x
Dawnlit: 2x
Dawnbound: 3x
Amberlit: 5x
Amberbound: 6x
Wet, Chilled and Frozen multipliers don't stack multiplicatively with Dawnlit/Dawnbound and Amberlit/Amberbound. Instead they stack like this:

Wet/Chilled & Dawnlit: 3x
Wet/Chilled & Amberlit: 6x
Frozen & Dawnlit: 11x
Frozen & Dawnbound: 12x
Frozen & Amberlit: 14x
Frozen & Amberbound: 15x
The above combination bonuses multiply with the 25x bonus of Golden and the 50x bonus of Rainbow to produce the following multipliers:

Golden, Wet/Chilled, & Dawnlit: 75x
Golden, Wet/Chilled, & Amberlit: 150x
Gold & Frozen: 250x
Golden, Frozen, & Dawnlit: 275x
Golden, Frozen, & Dawnbound: 300x
Golden, Frozen, & Amberlit: 350x
Golden, Frozen, & Amberbound: 375x
Rainbow, Wet/Chilled & Dawnlit: 150x
Rainbow, Wet/Chilled & Amberlit: 300x
Rainbow & Frozen: 500x
Rainbow, Frozen & Dawnlit: 550x
Rainbow, Frozen & Dawnbound: 600x
Rainbow, Frozen & Amberlit: 700x
Rainbow, Frozen & Amberbound: 750x
Gold and Rainbow do not stack, only one mutation can occur at once. Similarly a crop can only be Wet, Chilled, or Frozen, as the Frozen condition is obtained by combining Wet and Chilled. Dawnlit/Dawnbound and Amberlit/Amberbound do not stack and don't allow to be replaced by the other condition. With pet abilities that add mutations, it's possible to get Golden/Rainbow to overlap with Dawnlit/Dawnbound/Amberlit/Amberbound and Wet/Chilled/Frozen.

Common combinations that players use to increase coin yield are:

Gold & Frozen: 250x
Gold, Frozen & Amberlit: 350x
Rainbow & Frozen: 500x
Rainbow, Frozen & Amberlit: 700x
