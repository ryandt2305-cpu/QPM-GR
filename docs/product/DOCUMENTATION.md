## Feature Guides

### Shop Restock Tracker

Open via **Shop Restock** button:
- Predicted next restock time per item
- Average interval and appearance rate from historical data
- Data sourced from `restockDataService.ts`

### Journal Checker

In the **Journal** section:
- Visual progress: which crops and pets have been collected
- Smart Tip: recommends the next species to target
- Sprite icons for all 11 crop types and pet species

### Activity Log Enhancer

Enriches the native feed with:
- Feed/ability event timestamps
- Aggregated summaries visible via toggle
- Export entries: `QPM_ACTIVITY_LOG.export()`
- API: `QPM_ACTIVITY_LOG.list()`, `.clear()`, `.verify()`, `.status()`

### Controller / Gamepad

```

### Build Commands

```bash
npm run build                # Full build (recommended)
npm run build:bundle         # Vite IIFE output only
npm run build:userscript     # Wrap bundle → dist/QPM.user.js
npm run dev                  # Watch mode
npm run typecheck            # (if available) Type-check without building
```

### Version Sync Procedure

Every release must update **all three** of these files or the build will fail:

| File | What to update |
|------|----------------|
| `package.json` | `"version": "X.Y.Z"` |
| `src/utils/versionChecker.ts` | `CURRENT_VERSION = 'X.Y.Z'` |
| `src/ui/sections/statsHeaderSection.ts` | `CHANGELOG[0]` — version string + notes |

Run `npm run build:userscript` to verify. The script checks all three and fails with a diff if they disagree.

### Storage Keys

- Prefix: `qpm.` (new keys) or `quinoa` (legacy keys)
- Wrapper: `src/utils/storage.ts` — use `storage.get()` / `storage.set()` everywhere
- Register new keys in the `QPM_STORAGE_KEYS` array

### WebSocket Sends

All WS sends go through `sendRoomAction()` in `src/websocket/api.ts`:

```ts
import { sendRoomAction } from '../websocket/api';

function sendMyAction(itemId: string) {
  return sendRoomAction('ToggleFavoriteItem', { itemId }, { throttleMs: 90 });
}
```

**Never** call `MagicCircle_RoomConnection.sendMessage()` directly. Never send at module scope.

### Confirmed WS Message Types

| Type | Key Fields |
|------|-----------|
| `ToggleLockItem` | `itemId` |
| `ToggleFavoriteItem` | `itemId` |
| `FeedPet` | `petItemId`, `cropItemId` |
| `StorePet` | `itemId` |
| `PickupPet` | `petId` |
| `PlacePet` | `itemId`, `position`, `tileType`, `localTileIndex` |
| `SellPet` | `itemId` |
| `PlayerPosition` | *(position fields)* |
| `RetrieveItemFromStorage` | `itemId`, `storageId` |
| `PutItemInStorage` | `itemId`, `storageId` |
| `SwapPet` | `petSlotId`, `petInventoryId` |

### Debug API

Set `qpm.debug.globals.v1=true` in storage and reload to enable `QPM_DEBUG_API` on window.

Key methods:
```
QPM_DEBUG_API.debugPets()        — active pet info + raw data
QPM_DEBUG_API.feedAllPets(40)    — feed pets below 40% hunger
QPM_DEBUG_API.getCatalogs()      — raw captured game catalogs
QPM_DEBUG_API.diagnoseCatalogs() — catalog capture timing report
QPM_DEBUG_API.spriteProbe([...]) — test sprite lookup
QPM_DEBUG_API.activityLogList()  — activity log entries
```

Console shortcuts: `QPM_ACTIVITY_LOG.list()`, `QPM_ACTIVITY_LOG.export()`
